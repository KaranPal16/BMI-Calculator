# BMI-Calculator
A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool used to estimate an individual's body fat based on their height and weight. It's a simple formula that divides a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. The formula is: 

BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (mÂ²)

The result categorizes individuals into different ranges:

- Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
- Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
- Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
- Obesity: BMI of 30 or greater

It's important to note that while BMI is a useful screening tool, it doesn't directly measure body fat or health. Factors like muscle mass, bone density, and distribution of fat can influence BMI results. Consulting a healthcare professional for a comprehensive assessment is advisable for a better understanding of one's health status.
